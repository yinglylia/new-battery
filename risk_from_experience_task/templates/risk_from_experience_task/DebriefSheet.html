    <p>
        Thank you for participating in the experiment. The aim of this study is to look for relationships between
        certain individual behaviour strategies and decision-making in cooperative contexts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Previous research has shown that humans are outstanding co-operators from early in life. Different
        underlying mechanisms and motivations to explain these cooperative tendencies have been supposed by
        scientists. For example, we might cooperate to boost our reputation and invest in future relationships, or
        maybe because we feel a moral obligation to help others and engage in reciprocal activities.
    </p>
    <p>
        The aim of the current research is to learn more about the relationship of some more general cognitive traits
        and decision-making strategies (such as risky choice, future planning, and patience) with the level of
        cooperation that people exhibit.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the experiment, you played at least one of the tasks that will be used as either a predictor of cooperation
        or a measure of cooperation. For some games, trials are presented in a fixed order and arrangement, which is
        the same for each participant, and in some games trial presentation is dependent on a real co-playerâ€™s
        decisions. Your answers will help us better understand individual differences in people's tendencies to either
        behave cooperatively and trusting or to be selfish and skeptical in social scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>
        This study aims to examine the role of different cognitive factors for human cooperation. From a broader
        perspective, we will compare these results with parallel studies looking at the behaviour of children and
        chimpanzees in similar tasks. These comparisons will help us to shed light on the evolution and
        development of human cooperation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please do not discuss the purpose or nature of the study with others, as they may be participating in future
        trials. If you have any further questions about this study, please contact the researcher named above at the
        given email address.
