    <p class="text-center"><b>The Treasure Game</b></p>

    <p><b>Goal of the game</b></p>

    <p>
        You will now play a game in which you have to move a <b>yellow player (YOU)</b> to a
        treasure using the <b>mouse</b>. A treasure is worth {{ Constants.bonus_for_treasure }}.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will play multiple rounds of the game and <b>in each round</b>, you will be randomly and anonymously
        connected to <b>another player</b>. This player will also try to reach a treasure on the same field.
        You both pursue independent treasures, and you can both win a treasure in each round.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end, one of the rounds will be randomly drawn and in case you had reached
        your treasure in this round, you will receive {{ Constants.bonus_for_treasure }} as a bonus.
    </p>
    <p><b>How to play</b></p>

    <p>
        You must first choose one of two paths. Randomly falling <b>red and blue doors</b> on the paths
        <b>can stop you</b> from moving towards the treasure. A total of <b>six doors</b> fall randomly on the
        paths chosen by you and the other player, as well as on the paths not chosen.
        You can open these doors with <b>keys</b> at your disposal. You need red keys for red doors and blue
        keys for blue doors. In the right part of the display you can see the doors still to come and
        the keys available to you and the other player.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is an Example of the playing field:
    </p>
    <img src="{% static 'game/imgs/zpg_example_playing_field.png' %}" style="display: block; margin: auto; max-width: 100%">

    <p class="mt-5">
        Some rules to know:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You only have 60 seconds to reach the treasure.
            The time starts running when you choose one of the paths.
            The remaining time is shown on the game display.
        </li>
        <li>
            Each key can only be used once.
        </li>
        <li>
            If a door has not been opened, the player behind it will die after 7 seconds,
            losing the possibility of obtaining the treasure.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Letâ€™s start easy. First, you can practice the game on your own without another player.
        You get to play two games. In each game
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Choose a path for your character. Use the mouse to make your choice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Time starts running once you have made your choice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use the mouse to move along the path and to select keys from the right-hand panel.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Click CONTINUE to try out how the game works.
