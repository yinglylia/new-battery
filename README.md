Code for running a variety of behavioural experiments in oTree. 

## How to run

From terminal, type 

	otree devserver

You might need to install the dependencies first, i.e. from terminal `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. 


## How to set up a single activity

When you launch the app, you can choose from running any of the 3 session setups, which include a variety of games. Or you can run each game on it's own. You can also create Rooms with either one of the initial session setups or individual games. You can modify the activity sequences in `settings.py` under `SESSION_CONFIGS`.
